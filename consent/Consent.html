            <h3>Information and Consent</h3>
            <p>You are being invited to take part in an academic research study. Before you decide to participate in
                this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.
                Please take the time to read the following information carefully.</p>

            <h3>Purpose of the research</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this research is to better understand performance, creativity, and decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Who is doing this research?</h3>
            <p>The study is being conducted by Professor Oliver Hauser, Associate Professor of Economics at the
                University of Exeter Business School and Professor Anil Doshi, Assistant Professor of Strategy and
                Entrepreneurship at UCL School of Management.</p>

            <h3>Ethical review of this Research</h3>
            <p>This study has been reviewed by the University of Exeter Research Ethics Committee and received a
                favourable review. The review reference is {{review_ref}}. The University of Exeter Ethics Committee may
                be contacted at Research Ethics and Governance Office, University of Exeter, Lafrowda House, St Germans
                Road, Exeter, EX4 6TL, United Kingdom.</p>

            <h3>Procedures of this study</h3>
            <p>You will be asked to complete writing tasks. Then you will answer a short questionnaire, after which you
                will be asked about your demographics.</p>
            <p>Your participation will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. For completing the survey you will
                receive {{session.config.participation_fee}} as compensation for your time, and you could earn a
                possible bonus ranging from £0-1, depending on your decisions and the decision of others. You will
                receive clear instructions and will be provided with accurate information on how your answers will
                influence your payment.</p>
            <p>You will only receive payment if you complete and submit the whole survey. If you do withdraw from the
                study, the materials that you have completed up to that point will be deleted and will not be included
                in the study. However, you will NOT receive any financial compensation due to incomplete participation.
                All payments will be made to you via the Prolific payment system within two to three weeks of completing
                the survey. </p>
            <p>You may print a copy of this information sheet for your own records. If you have questions, concerns, or
                complaints, or think the research has hurt you, contact
                <a href="mailto:M.A.Fonseca@exeter.ac.uk">Miguel Fonseca</a> from the research team via email
            </p>

            <h3>Benefits and risks of taking part</h3>
            <p>There is unlikely to be any direct or personal benefit to you in taking part. There may be some benefit
                to society; but this cannot be assured at the start of any research project. There are no risks to
                taking part in this research greater than what you may encounter on a daily basis in your normal life.
                If you feel any discomfort or doubt about taking part you can stop at any time before completing the
                survey.</p>

            <h3>Voluntary participation and your right to withdraw</h3>
            <p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You are under no obligation to take part and you
                may stop at any time. If you stop before completing the survey your information will not be saved and
                you will not have completed the survey. Withdrawal after participation is not possible as your
                responses, once submitted, will not be identifiable to the researcher to enable removal from the
                dataset.</p>

            <h3>Anonymity</h3>
            <p>Your name and contact details are not provided by the survey provider (e.g. Prolific, MTurk) to the
                researcher. Your responses to this survey are therefore anonymous. They may contain some personal
                characteristics such as age, ethnicity and gender, but there will be no specific personal information
                such as name and contact details to identify you. Your responses to this survey are not subject to GDPR
                as there is no personally identifiable data.</p>
            <p>You may contact the survey referrer who will hold identifying personal data that you could request be
                deleted but this will not affect your participation in this study once completed. The Data Controller
                for this research is the University of Exeter. You may contact the
                <a href="mailto:dataprotection@exeter.ac.uk">Information Governance</a> office of the University of
                Exeter by email
